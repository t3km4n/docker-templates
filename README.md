# Description

unRAID Docker Templates for Docker images in the "t3km4n" repository.

## Usage

Firstly you need to be running unRAID ver 6.10.0 or later.  This also works better with the community apps plugin installed.  Once installed follow the instructions below:

1. Navigate to "/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates" and create a new folder called "t3km4n"
2. Git clone `git clone https://github.com/t3km4n/docker-templates` into the newly created folder
3. Once the files are downloaded you should see them appear in the "Default templates" when creating a new docker container
4. Git pull `git pull` to update the templates
